Chapter 14 & 16 in CS 1302

-Control: A.K.A widgets is an graphical icon that is diplayed on a Gui. The Gui on  the right has the following controls: button, text boxes, and labels. 

-Event Handler: is a piece of code that runs in response to a user interaction with a Gui. When a button is pressed a button event handler is called to compute.

-Pane: is a way to group controls. It is a logical structure defined at the programming level that is used to layout controls. The predecessor of JavaFX is Swing which utilized 
a JPanel(or just Panel). 

-Nested Panes: Panes can be nested to build more intricate GUIs. 

Java is on its third iteration of API's to support event driven programming. AWT was first, followed by Swing, and now we use JavaFX. 

-A label is a subclass of Control that simply displays (non-editable) text (and optionally a graphic). 
One contructor accepts the text that you want to display.
